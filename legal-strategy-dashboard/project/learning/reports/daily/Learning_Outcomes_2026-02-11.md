# Learning Outcomes 2026-02-11

## Metrics Summary
- Total interactions analyzed: 0
- Friction points identified: 0
- Retries/regenerations: 0
- Likes/dislikes: 0/0
- Corrections: 0

## Learning Outcomes
- Analyzed 0 interactions with 0 friction points.
- Activated 0 runtime rules under balanced guardrails.

## Improvement Goals
- Reduce retry_rate by 8% from rolling baseline.
- Reduce correction_rate by 8% from rolling baseline.
- Increase first_pass_success_rate by 8% from rolling baseline.

## Adopted Pathway
- Collect daily telemetry from codex sessions and dashboard events.
- Compute deterministic friction metrics and synthesize category-based rules.
- Activate only guarded rules and inject into runtime prompt construction.

## Actual Improvement With Evidence
- Current avg_friction=0.000; baseline=0.000; evidence from interaction_ids in analysis/2026-02-11/interactions.json.
- Current first_pass_success_rate=0.000; tracked in learning/goals/improvement_goals.json.
