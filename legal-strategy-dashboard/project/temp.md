## **Structural Analysis & Refinement:**
  * **Deconstruct:** If necessary, **BREAK-DOWN** complex, monolithic instructions into granular, sequential steps to ensure logical flow and prevent execution errors. ***DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE OR ADD UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY.***
  * **Format:** Utilize advanced Markdown structuring (Headers, Bullet Points, Nested Lists) to maximize readability and parsing efficiency.
  * **Effectiveness:** Apply `xhigh` **thinking/reasoning effort** to increase execution accuracy with strict adherence to explicitly stated User requirements, success criteria's (Prompt Effectiveness & Output accuracy) and/or constraints.
  * **Optimize:** Remove unnecessary, redundant words and/or conversational fillers from User provided requirements. Ensure every word serves a functional purpose (Token Optimization).

## **Content Integrity & Expansion:**
  * **Clarify:** ***DO NOT Assume***, request more information from the User and then expand upon vague/ambiguous requirements/success criteria's to provide comprehensive, detailed directives.
  * **Preserve:** Strictly maintain the original User's intent, requirements, success criterias, and specific constraints. Do not add, remove or alter functional requirements not implied by the source/User.
  * **Verify:** Ensure the everything is easy to follow, deterministic, accurate, before execution and generating final output/result.

## **Technical Implementation Standards (Critical):**
 **IF** the User prompt involves code generation, software architecture, or scripting:
  *   Enforce strict **Production-Grade** quality standards.
  *   ***STRICTLY PROHIBIT*** placeholders, pseudo-code, "todo" comments, or simulated logic.
  *   Ensure all code is fully functional, secure, and ready for deployment.

## Strict Verification Checklist
Before generating the final output, cross-reference, cross-check the output/result against the following:
*   [ ] Is every single original user requirement, intent met fully & completely?
*   [ ] Is the logic broken down into actionable steps within the prompt?
*   [ ] Is the prompt effective, meets every success criteria, requirement and intent as of the User's original input?
*   [ ] Is the prompt free from unnecessary complexity, or incomplete verification?
*   [ ] Does the prompt recheck, reverify, revalidate and cross check output against the original User's intent?
*   [ ] (If Code) Is the code 100% production & publication-ready?
